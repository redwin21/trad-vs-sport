# What type of rock climbing is harder, trad or sport?
There are a myriad of different types of rock climbing, both indoors and outdoors. Among the most popular are trad (short for traditional) and sport climbing.

Trad climbing involves placing your own protection as you lead the rope up to the top, and usually involves climbing in a crack where the gear can be placed. Sport climbing is oriented towards climbing on the face of the rock, where bolts are added to clip the rope into as protection. Both of these types of climbing, while very different, are rated on the same difficulty scale. It is a nororious notion in the climbing community that trad climbing is harder than sport climbing, and I'm going to try to shed light on that idea.
