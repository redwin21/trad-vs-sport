## Data Analysis Process

The data analysis process involved two major steps, exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing.

Exploratory data analysis was performed in the `eda.ipynb` file and consisted of visualizing the data in various degrees and at different angles to get a feel for it's features. I spent time looking for how much data was included in the different categories and for any relationships the data might show right off the bat. Everything was plotted using `matplotlib`.

The hypothesis test of whether trad climbing is harder than sport was performed in the `hypothesis_test.ipynb` file. Similarly to the EDA, several visualizations in `matplotlib` of the trad vs sport relationship were shown and various statistical quantifications were calculated. The main repository `README.md` summarizes the analysis and findings.

These two files could be rerun with the data to recreate the results.
